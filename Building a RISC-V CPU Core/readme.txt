I have decided to track the code written for this course after already having a
working version.
The next steps might be to actually make a decent version of the core:
-some pipelining
-real memory
-byte addressing on loads
All to be implemented in FPGA and be actually used with RISC-V assembly,
not just as a teching experiment.
